# Canadian craft beer recommendation engine
My final project for Concordia Data Science bootcamp: a craft beer recommendation engine built using a collaborative filtering approach and data scraped from ratebeer.com (over 130,000 entries). Users are asked to list their favorite Canadian beers; these are found using fuzzy matching, and a pre-trained scikit-surprise KNN model is employed for predictions. The styles of the user's favorite beers are also taken into account to provide more accurate recommendations. Once recommendations are generated, information about recommended beer styles, breweries, and their locations is extracted and presented to the user. Users can further filter recommendations by Canadian regions (BC, ON, QC, the Prairies, the Maritimes, or NL).
