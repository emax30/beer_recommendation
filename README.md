# Canadian craft beer recommendation engine
My final project for Concordia Data Science bootcamp: a craft beer recommendation engine built using a collaborative filtering approach and data scraped from [ratebeer.com](https://www.ratebeer.com/).
A user is asked to enter their favorite Canadian beers, a scikit-surprise KNN model is used for predictions and styles of the user's favorite beers are also taken into account for recommendations.
Once recommedations are generated, information about recommended beer styles, breweries and their locations are extracted and also presented to the user.
The user can also filter recommendations by Canadian region (BC, ON, QC, prairies or maritimes + NL).
